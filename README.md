Hello! My name is Macy, and I am a self-taught Data Scientist living in Wyoming. I have an extensive background in the pharmacutical industry. After acheiving a BS in Physiology, completing my MBA in International Business, and working as a quality scientist, I realized my passion throughout all my work and education lay in working with data. Since 2020, I have dedicated myself to learning Python, SQL, R, and Tableau to pursue my career in data science.
